## Docker entrypoints

> This script uses the exec Bash command so that the final running application becomes the containerâ€™s PID 1. This allows the application to receive any Unix signals sent to the container. For more, see the ENTRYPOINT reference.  [Dockerfile reference for the ENTRYPOINT instruction](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#entrypoint)
